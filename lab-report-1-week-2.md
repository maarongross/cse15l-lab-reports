# Step 1: Installing VSCode
- You can install VSCode at this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- After downloading the installation file for your operating system (i.e. Windows, Mac, etc.), you should then get a screen that looks something like this after opening the program (minus the code on screen).

# Step 2: Remotely Connecting
- If you are on Windows you have to install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse).
- Next go [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to find your login info.
- After this, you can now open a terminal in VSCode by going to Terminal and then New Terminal or just press Ctrl + Shift + `.
- In terminal type the following `$ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` where the zz is replaced by whatever is in your ieng6 email.
- Then, type "yes", hit enter, and then type your password (it won't show up in the terminal)
- You should then have something like this
